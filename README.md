# renovate-python-min-example
This repo was created to adress this discussion: https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate/discussions/28622

The goal is to make python version trackable by renovate. For now, the Dependency Dashboard shows that python was detected as a dependency but it does not show the option to update python even though it has newer versions available.
